Welcome to My GitHub Profile!! 

About Me:
Hey there! I'm Tawsia Rasool, a passionate Software Developer. I love exploring new technologies and building exciting projects. GitHub is my playground where I share my code and collaborate with the developer community.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently preparing for my placements.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the MERN stack.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with other software developers.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: tawsairasool62@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have a habit of talking to my hens. I believe that by speaking to them, they'll grow healthier and happier. So, you might catch me having conversations with my animal friends, discussing everything from the weather to my day's adventures. Who knows, maybe they secretly understand me and offer some 
advice in return!
